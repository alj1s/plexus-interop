Plexus Interop consist of the following main API layers:

image::desktop-interop-layers.png[]

All Applications are connected to central Broker.  To participate in interop each Application need to define itself in
Interop Registry and auto-generate its specific client API using code-generation tool. Broker loads Interop Registry on
startup and re-loads when it is changed in runtime to discover available actions, validate and route calls
between Applications.

==== Broker

Broker is a process running on user desktop which handles application connections, routes calls between them and able
to launch new applications instances on demand.

....
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
[Interop Broker] -up-> [App A Instance 1] : send/receive\nmessages
[Interop Broker] -right-> [App A Instance 2] : send/receive\nmessages
[Interop Broker] -down-> [App C Instance 1] : send/receive\nmessages
[Interop Broker] -left-> [App D Instance 1] : send/receive\nmessages
@enduml
....

Interop Broker has several responsibilities:

* It reads full information about all interoperability APIs from Interop Registry
* It routes interop API calls and replies between app instances
* It tracks which application instances are alive. If some app calls a service which is not online yet then Broker launches service provider app via App Lifecycle Manager.

==== Clients

Clients are technology-specific libraries used by Applications to communicate with Broker. Currently
Plexus Interop has 2 types of clients: for .NET and for TypeScript/JavaScript.

Clients communicate with Broker using Interop Protocol. Protocol messages are sent via Transport Protocol. Broker
can support one or more Interop and Transport protocols and Client can choose which of them to use.


==== Interop DSL
Interop DSL is a language for defining contracts between Applications, and associated tooling for parsing, validating and
code-generating of application-specific client APIs from these definitions.
