==== Application

Application is a program on client desktop which can be started and stopped. Each application can provide (i.e. implement)
services and/or consume (i.e. call) services provided by other applications.

Application is not necessary correspond to OS process. It can be a part of process, or consist of many processes.

Examples of applications:

* A program with GUI
* A program without GUI, e.g. Windows Service
* A part of process, e.g. a plugin running in a big container application consisting of many isolated plugins
* A web window or worker running in Electron.js or other web container

==== Application Instance

Application instance is a running (started) application. There can be many instances of the same application running
simultaneously on client desktop.

==== Interop Registry

Interop registry defines strong-typed contracts between applications on client desktop using a special human-readable
interface definition language.

It consist of definitions of the following types:

* **Message definitions** represent types of data which can be sent between applications.
* **Service definitions** represent named sets of related methods which can be implemented by applications. Service can
contain one or many methods and each method is defined by its name, type, and types of request and response.
* **Application definitions** declare which service implementations are provided and which consumed
by each application participating in desktop interop.

Broker loads Interop Registry from server on launch and re-loads it on changes. This allows adding new services to
user desktops in runtime.

Interop Registry enables dynamic service discovery. Applications are only connected to broker and call services rather
than other applications. This concept is similar to dynamic injection containers available in almost any language and
framework, but here it is used on a higher level. Broker dynamically searches for a suitable service implementation
across all the applications in Interop Registry. Because of this applications are always de-coupled from each other,
they don't need to know about counter-parties implementation details and they can release separately.

==== Broker

Broker is the central part of desktop interop. Broker accepts, authenticates and tracks application (client) connections,
validates and routes calls between them, and optionally can trigger launch of application on demand through
App Lifecycle Manager.

Broker listens to one or many wire protocol servers to accept client connections. Applications can use any of the
listened wire protocol implementations to establish connection with broker.

Application instance is considered "online" while it has at least one established connection with broker. Broker
uniquely identifies each connection and tracks it, so it always knows which apps are online in any given time.

Online applications instances can send protocol requests to broker to discover or call service implementations provided
by other applications. Broker validates and routes such calls to target applications according to interop registry.

==== Application Lifecycle Manager

Component inside Broker which tracks active connections and can trigger launch of an application on demand by sending a
request to the appropriate Application Launcher.

==== Application Launcher

Application launchers are applications which can launch other applications. This concept was introduced to allow easy
implementation of custom launch workflows which can be very different. E.g. web application is loaded in a browser window,
native application started as a new OS process and plugin is loaded by its container application. In addition each vendor
usually has custom launch steps like auto-updating or accepting terms & conditions. Such steps can also be implemented
in a vendor-specific app launcher.

On method call broker can either route the call to an online application instance or trigger launch of a new
instance. There are several strategies of routing launch requests from Broker to App Launcher, called _Launch Behaviors_:

* *Default* - Pass invocation to already running provider instance or launch new one if no online providers found.
* *Always* - Create new app instance on each invocation.
* *Never* - Pass invocation to already running instance, return error if no online providers found.

Launch Behaviors can be specified per action in Interop Registry, please see example below:
[source,javascript]
-------------------
application RateProviderApp {
    provides CcyPairBroadcastService {
        option launch_on_call = ALWAYS;
        GetRate;
    }
}
-------------------

Each application can specify its Launcher in Interop Registry and broker will delegate launch to
the specified Launcher.

==== Client

Client is a library used by application to communicate with interop broker. Client can be implemented in any language,
it communicates with broker using interop protocol, transport protocol and wire protocol.

==== Method
Like many other Remote Procedure Call (RPC) systems, Plexus Interop is based around the idea of defining a service by
specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types.

There are 4 possible types of RPC methods in Plexus Interop mirroring types supported by
http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html#rpc-life-cycle[gRPC]:

* Unary - consumer send a request, provider receives it, handles, and sends response back to the consumer.
* Consumer streaming - consumer sends one or many requests, provider sends only one response back.
* Provider streaming - consumer sends one request, provider sends many responses back.
* Bidirectional streaming - consumer sends many requests, provider sends many responses.


==== Discovery

Ability to dynamically discover service implementations. It allows using services in a decoupled way when consumer might
not even know where the called service is implemented.

Step one: find API implementations:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
[App A] -> [Interop Broker] : 1) discover API implementations
[Interop Broker] ..> [App A] : 2) apps B, C implement the API
[Interop Broker] .. [App B]
[Interop Broker] .. [App C]
[Interop Broker] .. [App D]
@enduml
....

Step two: select between API implementations

Step three: call specific API implementer:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
[App A] -> [Interop Broker] : 1) call API provided by app B
[Interop Broker] --> [App B] : 2) launch app B
[Interop Broker] --> [App B] : 3) call API
[Interop Broker] .. [App C]
[Interop Broker] .. [App D]
@enduml
....


==== Client Message Marshaller

Pluggable component used by client library to serialize and deserialize request/response messages.

==== Generic Client API
Technology-specific API implementation which provides core functionality of interop client. It converts method calls to interop protocol messages and vice versa according to specification and uses pluggable transport implementation to send/receive messages to/from broker.

Currently .NET and TypeScript/JavaScript libraries are provided.

==== Generated Client API

Application-specific wrapper on top of Generic Client API which is auto-generated based on Interop Registry by code-generation tool.

For each consumed service a proxy class is generated which allows invocation of service methods.

[source,javascript]
.Executing action using generated  proxy
-------------------
const rate: ICcyPairRate = client.getCcyRateService().getRate({ ccyPairName: 'EURUSD' });
-------------------

For each provided service an interface is generated which should be implemented to provide implementations for service
methods.

[source,javascript]
.Registering handler for provided service
-------------------
clientBuilder.withCcyRateServiceProvider({
    onGetRate: (invocattionContext: InvocationContext, pair: ICcyPair) => {
        return internalService.getRate(pair);
    }
});
-------------------

==== Interop Protocol

Interop Protocol is a language for conversations between client and broker through transport channels.

Each interop protocol conversation is performed within a separate transport channel.

Protocol describes 4 main types of conversations:

* Connect handshake - the first conversation performed after new transport connection is established
* Disconnect handshake - the last conversation performed before transport connection is closed
* Discovery - request from application to broker to get the available services filtered by specific parameters
* Method call - request from an application to call a method implemented in another application

==== Transport Protocol

Transport protocol is used to send binary messages between client and broker and is responsible for multiplexing and
de-multiplexing many channels through a single connection.

==== Transport Connection

Transport connection is an abstraction of established connectivity between client and broker.

Connection is initiated by client and accepted by broker.

Transport implementation must detect if the connection is still alive, e.g. by sending heartbeats or using lower-level
wire protocol capabilities for this, and raise "disconnected" event on both sides when connectivity is lost.

==== Transport Channel

Transport channel is a logical unit of data exchange through connection. It consist of request and response
byte streams on both sides of connection.

Channel opening can be initiated by both client and broker. It's only possible to write and read bytes to/from
an opened channel. Many channels can be simultaneously opened in the context of the same connection.

For example, for each call from one application to another, 2 transport channels are opened. First is opened by source
application to broker. Second is opened by broker to target application. All the data sent in context of the call
is transferred through these 2 channels.

Bytes written to request stream on one side of channel can be read in exactly the same order from response stream
on another side. As soon as one of the sides sent all the data it closes request stream. This triggers
response stream completion event on another side as soon as all the sent bytes consumed.

Channel considered "Completed" when both sides completed request stream and consumed all the bytes from response stream.
Additionally it can be terminated by either client or broker with either "Failed" or "Canceled" status in case of
exception.

==== Wire Protocol

Wire protocol is an abstraction for sending bytes through cross-process boundaries. Any existing stream-based network
protocol such as named pipes or websockets can be used as a wire protocol for Plexus Interop.

Broker listens to many wire protocols simultaneously on different addresses, so each client can choose which one to use.
Usually for native apps it's more convenient to use named pipes, but for web apps it's more convenient to use websockets,
because most of browsers has built-in websockets support.

==== Wire Connection

Wire connection is an abstraction of established cross-process connection.
