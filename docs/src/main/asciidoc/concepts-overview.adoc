The **Plexus Interop** project aims to define an open standard for desktop application interoperability and provides
reference implementation of this standard. It formalizes connections between applications within a single user session
on client desktop through a central broker.

The main goal is to enable development of extensible workflows connecting independent apps developed by different
organizations in different technologies (.NET, Web, Java, Python, etc.) by passing relevant context  (structured
data objects) between those apps.

Although the industry is moving towards containerized desktop applications, Plexus Interop recognizes that much
of the application landscape is not yet tied to containers and is architecturally agnostic of container implementation.
Separating interoperability from the container provides notable advantages: different containers can be leveraged in
the same workflow, and launched applications residing outside of containers can participate in interop activities.

Technically speaking, Plexus Interop is a metadata-centric language-agnostic desktop app-to-app interoperability
framework with an extensible model for launching new instances of desktop applications on demand. Its extensibility
is based on open standards which are essential parts of the project.  The architecture is based around central broker
providing hub-and-spoke connectivity between apps and brokering strongly-typed RPC-style calls between them. The broker
has a connection to an Application Lifecycle Manager (or Launcher) which is capable of creating new instances of apps
based on the their runtime-metadata (e.g. container type, launch command, command line parameters) defined in a registry.
