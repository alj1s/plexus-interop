This section presents the most interesting scenario of invocation, which includes app launch:

[plantuml]
....
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true
participant "Service Consumer Application" as ConsumerComponent
participant "Interop Broker" as InteropBroker
participant "Interop Registry" as InteropRegistry
participant "App Registry" as AppRegistry
participant "App Lifecycle Manager" as AppLifecycleManager
participant "Some App Launcher" as AppLauncher
participant "Service Provider Application" as ProviderApplication

ConsumerComponent -> InteropBroker : send request message to invoke service method
InteropBroker -> InteropRegistry : find service provider application
InteropBroker -> InteropBroker: check if provider application is connected
InteropBroker -> AppLifecycleManager: request launch of provider application
AppLifecycleManager -> AppRegistry: get app launcher id and launch params
AppLifecycleManager -> AppLauncher: request launch by providing launch params
AppLauncher -> ProviderApplication: launch app and provide instance id and broker connectivity details
AppLifecycleManager <-- AppLauncher: launched app instance id
InteropBroker <-- AppLifecycleManager: launched app instance id
InteropBroker -> InteropBroker: wait for launched app with the specified id connected
ProviderApplication --> InteropBroker: connect to broker
InteropBroker -> ProviderApplication: send request message to invoke service method
ProviderApplication --> InteropBroker: response
InteropBroker --> ConsumerComponent: response

* When Desktop Plexus is started it creates transport endpoints and start listen for incoming connections.
* Plexus Interop launches app A and provides it with the configuration on how to connect to transport servers.
* App A initializes Client APIs and connects to Broker. Client and Broker performs handshake after which Broker registers the connected instance start tracking it.

Now user wants to send some information from app A into another app B available in Plexus. Here is what happens in app A:

* App A creates an input message instance using builder provided by Client API library
* App A calls service method in Client API and passes created message instance
* Client API performs several steps:
** Creates header which contains information about the invocation: sender, receiver, service name, method name etc.
** Serializes the created header via Protobuf and submits into Interop Transport for sending
** Serializes the created input message into binary stream using Protobuf and submits into Interop Transport for sending
** Transport splits the incoming message stream into one or more frames and send them to the pipe

Plexus Host process is doing the following:

* Interop Transport reads binary stream from transport and re-constructs headers and messages from received frames.
* When new *header* arrives Transport starts to build new message blob from frames related to the message
* Once header and message blobs are constructed, Transport passes them into Interop Broker
* Interop Broker deserializes header blob and checks information about message receiver
* If target app is not running then Interop Broker sends "launch app" event to App Launcher with the ID of app B and waits
* App Launcher starts target app B. After launch app B will:
** Register callback for process API calls
** Register its instance in Interop Broker (same as app A)
* Interop Broker detects that app B is live and sends message into it using Transport

Now that message is sent to app B via transport remaining part is easy:

* Interop Transport within app B restores message blob and passes it into Client API
* Client API deserializes blob into strongly typed message and invokes callback registered by app B code
* App B processes the message and sends reply using same approach as original request, but in reverse direction
